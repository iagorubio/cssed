README FILE
-----------


Thanks for trying cssed.

Please read http://cssed.sourceforge.net before installing this application and 
read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

If you feel lazy to do that, just type from the root directory of this 
distribution:

$ ./configure

If you're using Linux, and configure fails for some reason involving 
Makefile.in files try to run.

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure

Then you can run:

$ make

To get cssed installed in your system use the command:

$ make --install

All your feedback and help will be welcomed.

UPDATING FROM CVS
-----------------

When you update this project - and any other - from cvs, and the build scripts
for the projects have changed, you must rebuild them.

To acomplish this task, you've got two script with this distribution:

* autogen.sh - rebuild all scripts even if it's not needed. 
* bootstrap - try to rebuild the missing files and change just the required
scripts (MacOsX users: don't use it).

Both put the source tree in a state where you must use the above instructions
to build and install the updated package.


BUILDING ON Mac OS X
------------------

To compile it on Mac OS X, you need:

* a Fink installation using the 10.3 or 10.4 unstable tree
* Apple's X11 and X11SDK installed.

To enable Fink's unstable tree:
Open a terminal and type:

$ sudo pico /sw/etc/fink.conf + return

Enter your password when asking for.
Change the Trees lines as follows:
Trees: local/main stable/main unstable/main stable/crypto unstable/crypto local/bootstrap

Be aware it should be one and unique line
Save the result as follows:

ctrl-O +return
ctrl-X

Update your Fink installation with:

fink selfupdate + return

Install cssed:

fink install cssed + return
